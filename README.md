# Interhemispheric Reaction Times

## Short description

My project will be a simple experiment investigating the following research question: How much time does it take for information to cross from one hemisphere to the other? (Corresponding to the first project on the list on the PCBS website)

The setup will be the following:
- The stimulus will be a cross appearing in random intervals between 1 and 5 seconds in the center of a full screen. The task will be to press either the 'F' key with the left or the 'G' key with the right index as fast as possible after the stimulus onset. Reaction times are going to be measured.
- There will be 2 factors with 2 levels each (i.e. 4 conditions in total): Subjects will either have only their right eye (R) or their left eye (L) seeing, while the other is closed; and at the beginning of a block, subjects will be asked to either respond ipsolaterally (i) or contralaterally (c) to the seeing eye (i.e. responding with right hand when left eye is closed, or responding with left hand when left eye is closed).
- There will thus be 4 blocks of 15 trials each: (1) R-i, (2) L-c, (3) R-c, (4) L-i.
